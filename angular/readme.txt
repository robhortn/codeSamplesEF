These files are from the project we discussed in the interview, LockBoxSocial.  I've taken care not to share anything proprietary here as I would never want to do that.  This is an example of Angular 1.x code that I wrote for some controllers/views in that project.

For this html file and angular controller the agent would use this view to create a campaign listing. Think of a realtor who is selling a home, creating a listting for it, running a campaign and then managing those listings.  This was part of that process for LockBoxSocial.
