These files are from the project we discussed in the interview, LockBoxSocial.  I've taken care not to share anything proprietary here as I would 
never want to do that.  

These are C# examples for controllers that I worked on. While I did not write all of this code, I did create new endpoints for getting 
the campaign listings.  

[GetCampaignUrlsByListingId]
[GetSocialMediaAccountBySocialMediaSiteId]

I pretty much still write REST endpoints very similar to this today.
